 * Functions in this file:
 * - fetchAiApiKey(): Fetches the API key needed for poem generation.
 * - handleRequestDelay(): Displays a loading message with a typewriter effect.
 * - craftPromptUrl(): Crafts the URL needed for the API request based on user input.
 * - generatePoem(): Makes the API request to generate the poem and handles the response.
 * - typePoem(): Displays the generated poem with a typewriter effect.
 * - handleSubmit(): Handles the form submission for poem generation.
